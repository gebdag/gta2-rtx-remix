// How far a sprite is lifted off the floor it stands on.
//
// GTA2 itself lifts them by nothing at all. Its object pass puts all four
// corners of the quad at exactly the level of the block underneath - read back
// out of the game's own vertex shadow, a pedestrian at cell (158,138) comes out
// as (158.2656 138.7500 2.0000) (158.2656 138.2500 2.0000) (158.7344 138.2500
// 2.0000) (158.7344 138.7500 2.0000), all four at 2.0000, while the floor there
// is the lid at 2.0. Perfectly coplanar.
//
// It gets away with that because its renderers never depth test: 3dfx.dll calls
// grDepthBufferFunction(GR_CMP_ALWAYS) and imports no grDepthMask or
// grDepthBufferMode at all, and d3ddll.dll never sets ZENABLE, ZWRITEENABLE or
// ZFUNC. Both are pure painter's algorithm - the map is drawn level by level and
// the object pass paints over the floor it just laid down. That is also why the
// screen-space overlay pass never had this problem: it replays submission order
// with no depth test, which is the original behaviour exactly.
//
// Turning a sprite into real 3D geometry is what breaks it. Coplanar surfaces
// have no defined order in 3D: the depth test drops them, and under Remix the
// ray hit is ambiguous however the raster state is set, so ZFUNC_LESSEQUAL would
// fix the raster view and still leave the path tracer fighting itself.
//
// So the lift is ours and has to be justified rather than guessed.
//
// A quarter of a ground texel - 1/256 of a block, the first value used here -
// is enough to break the coplanarity and nothing more. That settles flat
// ground, and does nothing at all for a slope: GTA2 gives all four corners of
// the quad the object's single level, so on a ramp a horizontal quad cuts
// straight through the lid and the uphill half of the sprite disappears into
// it. A sprite of length L on a gradient g sinks by up to g*L/2.
//
// Measured over the shipped districts, of the surfaces a sprite can actually
// stand on (ground type road or pavement, 16419 of them):
//
//     flat                                  72.06%
//     7 degrees   (8 steps, g = 0.125)      21.88%
//     26 degrees  (2 steps, g = 0.5)         5.92%
//     45 degrees  (1 step,  g = 1.0)         0.14%
//
// A pedestrian quad is 0.47 blocks across (measured off the game's own shadow
// slots), a car about 2. So 1/8 of a block clears 99.5% of the sloped surfaces
// a pedestrian can reach and 78% of those a car can, which is every 7 degree
// ramp - the common case by a wide margin. Doubling it to 1/4 buys nothing more
// for cars, and it takes a full 1/2 block to cover them on 26 degree ramps,
// which floats every sprite in the city half a block to fix 6% of surfaces.
//
// 1/8 of a block is roughly 25 cm at GTA2's scale, and the camera looks almost
// straight down, so the float it costs is far less visible than the clipping it
// removes. It is a compromise, not a fix: the real answer is to tilt the quad
// to the lid underneath it, which needs the ground plane per corner and is not
